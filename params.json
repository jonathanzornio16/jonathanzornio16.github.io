  "body": "### 5/11/2016\r\nToday was rather annoying.  For most of the day, it looked like I was on track to finish the 2D Rougelike project with a little time to spare.  However, near the end of the tutorials, I ran into a nasty bug where the objects in the game won't recognize the GameManager object that is scripted to be generated at the start of the game.  I spent over an hour trying to fix this issue, and double checked all of my scripts.  However, I could not find anything.  As the tutorial has only been checked against unity 5, and I am running unity 5.36, my guess is that the syntax for this might have changed.  Tomorrow, I am going to replace all of my scripts with all of the completed scripts that are included in the project and see if it results in a functional game.  If it works, then I might search a little more to see what else I could have done wrong, but I also want to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the larger project at hand.  I am going to search the asset store to see if I can find some good free stuff, as most of the assets not connected to the tutorials seem to have a price tag on them.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if I had to create an idea for a game that was limited to the default asset packages in Unity and the ones I downloaded for the tutorials.  As it seems likely that there will be time for it, I will also get the GitHub page up and running.  I'm just not feeling it tonight after what I just went through.  I might alo review the end of the Space Shooter tutorial that explained how to upload games to the web and see in advance if I can make that happen.  That would definitely be a nice thing to have. \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
