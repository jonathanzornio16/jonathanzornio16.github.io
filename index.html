<p>Today was rather annoying.  For most of the day, it looked like I was on track to finish the 2D Rougelike project with a little time to spare.  However, near the end of the tutorials, I ran into a nasty bug where the objects in the game won't recognize the GameManager object that is scripted to be generated at the start of the game.  I spent over an hour trying to fix this issue, and double checked all of my scripts.  However, I could not find anything.  

As the tutorial has only been checked against unity 5, and I am running unity 5.36, my guess is that the syntax for this might have changed.  Tomorrow, I am going to replace all of my scripts with all of the completed scripts that are included in the project and see if it results in a functional game.  

If it works, then I might search a little more to see what else I could have done wrong, but I also want to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the larger project at hand.  I am going to search the asset store to see if I can find some good free stuff, as most of the assets not connected to the tutorials seem to have a price tag on them.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if I had to create an idea for a game that was limited to the default asset packages in Unity and the ones I downloaded for the tutorials.  As it seems likely that there will be time for it, I will also get the GitHub page up and running.  I'm just not feeling it tonight after what I just went through.  I might alo review the end of the Space Shooter tutorial that explained how to upload games to the web and see in advance if I can make that happen.  That would definitely be a nice thing to have.

<p>Today, I decided that I wanted to do one of the 2D tutorials, as I figured that building a 2D game in unity would be significantly different, and it turns out that I was right.  I want to say that building a 2D game is overall easier than building a 3D game, but there are also parts that are added to it or significantly different, and because this is my first 2D game, it's definitely not a complete cruise.  I think it won't take too long though.  

The main thing that was different about the 2D rougelike tutorial was that it included a sprite package, and went into some detail about how to combine sprites into animations in Unity.  This reminds me a lot of what I had to do when using other game making software.  

I also worked on creating a new blog that would be neater than this to post these entries a bit today.  This site can be found at jonathanzornio16.github.io.

However, I found that the uses of being able to show code conveniently in GitHub seems to be lost when using a GitHub page.  It probably would have been better to use a more normal blogging site for this project.  I will probably finish setting up what I started tomorrow though.

I am thinking that my final game will be 3D, because making a 3D game feels like a better way to use the new skills that I've developed.  There are plenty of good ways to make 2D games.

<p>I spent today finishing the tanks project, and I am very happy with how it came out.  The fact that it is a 2 player game makes it difficult to playtest in order to mess around with variables to my personal taste, but since this is just a practice project, that is not a big deal.  

Unlike the other two projects that I have worked on so far, this felt like a complete game.  Some of the effects were quite a bit flashier, such as making a health bar for each tank that changes color as it decreases and is represented by a circle that follows around the tank.  I also had my first experience working on mixing audio today.

The video tutorial was also recorded from a live presentation, which helped me pick up on a few tricks from digressions in the video that would not have been present in a scripted tutorial.  For example, searching "sou" will actually take you directly to audio source underneath the components menu, which are otherwise pretty hidden to find.

I think I will do one more practice project before starting on my own independant game.  I might also look at a few more tutorials for fun.

<p>As I've decided that practice projects feel llike the way to go, I've spent the day today working on the tanks tutorial.  I am around halfway done if I had to guess, as this project is slightly more complicated, and I found the correct version without ready made scripts this time.

I have a better sense of what I'm going to be doing while creating my own game.  Although the interface of Unity felt like a significant wall for the first two days, I am now feeling very comfortable with it, and I realize now that I will be spending most of my effort scripting, and the rest of it finding assets and making compound colliders if I choose to use them over mesh colliders or working on animations if I work those in, which are three things that are already done for you in the tutorials.  It seems quite likely that I will be looking back at the scripts that the tutorials helped me write fairly often, but I can also tell that I've slowly built an understanding for most of the basics that tend to get reused a lot.

The scripting aspect of the project definitely feels by far the most important, so I may choose to skip the animation tutorials to focus in more on that.

<p>Today felt much more tricky.  Although I ultimately ended up with a functional finished product by following the space shooter tutorial, the asset package I downloaded contained the scripts required for the project, which felt liek a large part of the project.  It turned out that this package was part of a seperate tutorial for a cloud software called BrainCloud that used the simple space shooter game to show how it could be used to save and merge the statistics at the end of the game, such as the shot accuracy.  

Even with the codes pre-written, this project took up most of the day, and definitely felt more challenging.  I did learn some aspects about how to work with audio in Unity, and also got some more experience with organizing Hierarchy, so the experience was definitely still good.

I would link the game here, but unfortunately, Chrome, my default browser, does not support the Unity player.  It works fine when I target the build for Windows though.  I will probably have to temporarily switch my default browser to Firefox.

<p>I feel like I've learned a lot more today than I initially expected to.  After reviewing some interface tutorials, I managed to complete the Rollong a Ball project. located at https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial

Although the product produced was very simple, actually running through the motions of creating a game gave me a much better idea of how many features of the program work, including rigid bodies which allow for physics simulations, materials that allow for coloring or texturing objects, and prefabs, which allow for the generation of identical objects within a game.

I also got my first chance to script in C#, and founnd that my extremely basic knowledge of the syntax was sufficient for following the tutorial.  Additionally, there is an extensive document with all of the unity specific functions, and hitting control + ' allows for research in a way very similar to writing a ? and then hitting tab in SageMath.

After completing the project, I looked into some of the tutorials explaiining the concets of the physics engine, mostly as a review.  There were a few options not covered in the Roll a Ball project though, such as the ability to prevent rotation in certain axes.

Overall, Unity is more physics-based than I anticipated, but there will probably still be a good amount of time spent figuring out the coding.  The project definitely feels much more doable after dippping my feet in and actually creating something with Unity.
