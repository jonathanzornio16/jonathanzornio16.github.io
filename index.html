<p>  Today, I coded the movement pattern for the balloons.  To my surprise, this took the majority of the day, but at least I am very happy with the end result.  

I posted this code in the same GitHub repository that generates this website.  Not that much time was spent writing it, but a lot of time was spent debugging it as well as plugging in magic numbers for all of my declared floats in the console that made me happy with the balloon's movement.  The end result is a balloon that floats around in a sinusoidal pattern towards the player's base that smoothly transitions into a descent at a specified distance.  Finally, the balloon creates an explosion when it hits the base.

Part of the reason that I am posting this is because this code is the longest that I've directly written rather than modified for my needs (it's also one of the longest in general), since what I wanted from this code was fairly unique to my game.  However, I have also spent a bit of time today thinking about my presentation, which made me realize that I should consider adding a piece of code to GitHub.  As I plan on using this computer to present, I might just pull up MonoDevelop and show some piece of code there, since I am more interested in showing the Unity interface than I've been working with than explaining any code I write.  Still, it could be nice to have here.

The game itself is coming along pretty nicely.  All I need to do is create spawners that generate these balloons and create a user interface that shows base damage in order for my game to feel like it has a functional purpose to it outside of being a fun flight simulator.  I will probably turn towards the presentation soon rather than pushing out additional features that I want, as I can keep working on this project after the presentation.

<p>  I'm a lot happier with how things went today.  I spent the entirety of today working towards 4 things: picking out assets that I decided I wanted to use for enemies and a boss (which I have been thinking about for a while... I think I have a good idea, though it may be tricky to implement), building a brand new scene and terrain for a boss level, getting a few more textures for the scene, and adding stuff in to get reasonable scalings.  There is definitely a lot of programming left to do on all of these fronts, and I still want to add a user interface at some point, but today at least felt much more focused in terms of what I wanted to work on.  The boss scene and fight might be biting off more than I can chew in a few more days, so I should really work on the other stuff first.

Most importantly, Unity didn't ever crash today.  MonoDevelop crashed once or twice, but that doesn't count.  That's about all that matters.

</p>

<p>  Today was kind of draining.  I made a fair amount of progress, but I had to deal with at least 10 crashes that caused me to have to check for changes that were and were not saved.  All but one or two of them did not cause much progress to be lost at all, but it felt like a lot of my time was spent waiting on the software today, and that's pretty annoying.  While restarting definitely helps, it turns out that a school computer wasn't the intended target for running Unity.

As far as what I got done goes, I started by editing the particle effects and sound for the explosion, which I managed to get right pretty quickly today (though I had to get them right twice thanks to my computer).  I also quickly modified some code to get it so that explosions wouldn't be generated on the boundary or the speed upgrade, as I noticed these occuring while debugging other stuff.  I also made it so that the speed upgrade rotates, and adjusted the collider accordingly.  I did some other small fixes that I probably forgot about as well.

There are two main projects that I started looking into today but didn't complete.  The first one is adding an enemy, which I was honestly hoping to make more headway on.  I'm thinking that these enemies might end up being balloons.  Right now, the game is surprisingly fun to fly around in, and could probably be presented as a senior project, but doesn't have a real purpose to it.  The second thing I tried to work on today was making the bullet speed relative to the plane's speed when firing.  For some reason, this flat out didn't work, and when I told it to print the velocity vector of the plane in the debug log whenever I recieved the zero vector as a result even when the plane moved.  This project as a whole isn't as high a priority, and doing this would even have the downside of making a higher percentage of bullets fly through the terrain instead of colliding with it, which is a glitch that already happens sometimes.

I've noticed a recurring theme that relatively simple tasks can become very drawn out when you get pelted with crashes and bugs to fix.  I expected to have an enemy by now, though that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm behind on the project.  This is further compounded b the fact that I'm still new, and even though I've noticed myself using documentation or looking at tutorial code far less, the inexperience still hurts at times, as there are probably a few holes here and there.

<p>  I managed to fix some more issues today.  The main problem I had at the end of yesterday was the the explosion wasn't functioning correctly.  After looking in the unity code directory some more, I discovered that Instantiate uses the origin rather that the transform of the object with the script attached as a default location for spawning objects.  This caused my explosions to always appear off the map, and was not too hard to fix.  Another problem that I had was that the bullets would sometimes fly through the terrain.  There's no real way to stop this other than to slow down the speed a lot, but I did it as much as I could today while still looking good.

  I also looked at the directory a bit more in order to figure out how to make the audio work with 3D sound (which uses distance), but I am still figuring out the correct settings.

<p>  I feel like I got more done today, but still didn't cover as much ground as I'd like.  I got the shooter to work todaay, but a lot of time was spent debugging it.  There was even one point where shooting the weapons would destroy the camera, which I thought was pretty funny.  I fixed that by tagging the children of the plane with "Player", which stopped this issue but then caused the camera to go crazy, because the camera looks for one object tagged with Player to follow in a fixed position.  The result was a view from directly above the plane, and was actually kind of cool.  I'm tempted to use it as a feature, but the view was definitely too hard to fly around with when you can't really see in front of you.  

Those bugs were definitely the highlight of my day.  I solved them by making a new tag called PlayerParts that I tagged the child objects with, and then modified the code accordingly.  I had a few other bugs that I had to deal with, but nothing as memorable. While the weapon now shoots properly, I want the shots to be able to interact with the terrain, which they do not appear to be doing.  I also need to add some things to shoot at, and work some special effects there.  

Other than that, I added a greener grass texture to my terrain and added it to some areas, which definitely helps differentiate the landscapes better.  I also added a collectible object that can boost engine power.  I had some fun messing around with those.  I'm not sure if I want these in fixed positions that make sense for the maps or randomly distributed by code.

<p>  Today was a rather slow day in terms of progress.  I started out today by moving the control of the enginge brake to the right mouse button, and switching around the controls so that the brakes apply when the button is not held.  The control now has a very nice feel to it in testing.  After that, I discovered how to enlarge my terrain instead dof having to add new ones, adding some elevation to my terrain, as well as figuring out how to make use of opacity to get the different mixes of textures that I wanted for different regions of the map.  I also added boundaries today, as weird things always happen when the plane flies outside of the terrain, and especially underneath it.  

Both Unity and MonoDevelop crashed on me several times today, which really slowed down how much progress I made.  The MonoDevelop errors did not specify any sort of cause, but the Unity errors were memory-related.  I closed out a bunch of old tabs and restarted my computer, so hopefully that won't be an issue tomorrow.

I started working on getting my player to be able to shoot, but these crashes definitely slowed me down.  I'll finish that one up tomorrow.

<p>  It feels odd to transition from being completely guided through the process of making a game to suddenly being taken off of the leash.  That said, I am at least making progress for now.

I searched through the packages I found yesterday and this morning and began to figure out what I wanted to use in a game. What stood out to me by far the most was the airplane, which already had motion pre-programmed into it and had a lot of different components and animations to work off of.  Making a flying game also seems like a great use of the unity space, since it makes good use of the Y axis, so that part is settled.

I also discovered a type of asset called a terrain while searching through some of the assets today.  As the plane covers ground very quickly, these terrains will be very important, as they are by far the most efficient way to create ground in Unity, as they are simply made out of a tile that gets repeated over and over again and a terrain collider.  To make the scene look less repetitive, there is also a very efficient way to add trees, which were included in the standard assets.  Terrain can also be raised, lowered, and retiled by using different sized brushes.  I'm definitely very glad that I found these, and spent a significant part of the day playing around with them.

Next week, I am probably going to have to get back into scripting.  While the plane moves properly and responds to certain controls, I don't like the way that some of these controls are configured.  I also learned how to change these due to a tangent in the Tanks tutorial.  I've done some tweaking today, but not enough.

<p>  Today felt a bit more laid back.  Although I've been happy with what I've done so far, it was nice to have a day where I didn't spend the majority of the time coding. 

First off, I managed to confirm today that the completed project for the 2D Rougelike gave me the same error, so I don't believe it was my fault.  I could look into a way to try to fix this, but the project as a whole seemed much less relevant to what I was planning to do, so I'd rather not dig into it too heavily.

After that, I updated this webpage with all of my past entries, and then looked at some assets today.  There are a lot of free assets, but most of them involve one specific object.  The best find was probably the standard assets that Unity provides on the store, but does not automatically come with.  I also found some assets pertaining to a short film called The Blacksmith that was made by unity.

Overall, today felt more uneventful, but I'm probably OK with that.  Tomorrow, I'm going to have to look through what I've got (and maybe a few more packages), piece together a game plan, and then see if I can find anything else pertaining to that.

<p>Today was rather annoying.  For most of the day, it looked like I was on track to finish the 2D Rougelike project with a little time to spare.  However, near the end of the tutorials, I ran into a nasty bug where the objects in the game won't recognize the GameManager object that is scripted to be generated at the start of the game.  I spent over an hour trying to fix this issue, and double checked all of my scripts.  However, I could not find anything.  

As the tutorial has only been checked against unity 5, and I am running unity 5.36, my guess is that the syntax for this might have changed.  Tomorrow, I am going to replace all of my scripts with all of the completed scripts that are included in the project and see if it results in a functional game.  

If it works, then I might search a little more to see what else I could have done wrong, but I also want to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the larger project at hand.  I am going to search the asset store to see if I can find some good free stuff, as most of the assets not connected to the tutorials seem to have a price tag on them.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if I had to create an idea for a game that was limited to the default asset packages in Unity and the ones I downloaded for the tutorials.  As it seems likely that there will be time for it, I will also get the GitHub page up and running.  I'm just not feeling it tonight after what I just went through.  I might alo review the end of the Space Shooter tutorial that explained how to upload games to the web and see in advance if I can make that happen.  That would definitely be a nice thing to have.

<p>Today, I decided that I wanted to do one of the 2D tutorials, as I figured that building a 2D game in unity would be significantly different, and it turns out that I was right.  I want to say that building a 2D game is overall easier than building a 3D game, but there are also parts that are added to it or significantly different, and because this is my first 2D game, it's definitely not a complete cruise.  I think it won't take too long though.  

The main thing that was different about the 2D rougelike tutorial was that it included a sprite package, and went into some detail about how to combine sprites into animations in Unity.  This reminds me a lot of what I had to do when using other game making software.  

I also worked on creating a new blog that would be neater than this to post these entries a bit today.  This site can be found at jonathanzornio16.github.io.

However, I found that the uses of being able to show code conveniently in GitHub seems to be lost when using a GitHub page.  It probably would have been better to use a more normal blogging site for this project.  I will probably finish setting up what I started tomorrow though.

I am thinking that my final game will be 3D, because making a 3D game feels like a better way to use the new skills that I've developed.  There are plenty of good ways to make 2D games.

<p>I spent today finishing the tanks project, and I am very happy with how it came out.  The fact that it is a 2 player game makes it difficult to playtest in order to mess around with variables to my personal taste, but since this is just a practice project, that is not a big deal.  

Unlike the other two projects that I have worked on so far, this felt like a complete game.  Some of the effects were quite a bit flashier, such as making a health bar for each tank that changes color as it decreases and is represented by a circle that follows around the tank.  I also had my first experience working on mixing audio today.

The video tutorial was also recorded from a live presentation, which helped me pick up on a few tricks from digressions in the video that would not have been present in a scripted tutorial.  For example, searching "sou" will actually take you directly to audio source underneath the components menu, which are otherwise pretty hidden to find.

I think I will do one more practice project before starting on my own independant game.  I might also look at a few more tutorials for fun.

<p>As I've decided that practice projects feel llike the way to go, I've spent the day today working on the tanks tutorial.  I am around halfway done if I had to guess, as this project is slightly more complicated, and I found the correct version without ready made scripts this time.

I have a better sense of what I'm going to be doing while creating my own game.  Although the interface of Unity felt like a significant wall for the first two days, I am now feeling very comfortable with it, and I realize now that I will be spending most of my effort scripting, and the rest of it finding assets and making compound colliders if I choose to use them over mesh colliders or working on animations if I work those in, which are three things that are already done for you in the tutorials.  It seems quite likely that I will be looking back at the scripts that the tutorials helped me write fairly often, but I can also tell that I've slowly built an understanding for most of the basics that tend to get reused a lot.

The scripting aspect of the project definitely feels by far the most important, so I may choose to skip the animation tutorials to focus in more on that.

<p>Today felt much more tricky.  Although I ultimately ended up with a functional finished product by following the space shooter tutorial, the asset package I downloaded contained the scripts required for the project, which felt liek a large part of the project.  It turned out that this package was part of a seperate tutorial for a cloud software called BrainCloud that used the simple space shooter game to show how it could be used to save and merge the statistics at the end of the game, such as the shot accuracy.  

Even with the codes pre-written, this project took up most of the day, and definitely felt more challenging.  I did learn some aspects about how to work with audio in Unity, and also got some more experience with organizing Hierarchy, so the experience was definitely still good.

I would link the game here, but unfortunately, Chrome, my default browser, does not support the Unity player.  It works fine when I target the build for Windows though.  I will probably have to temporarily switch my default browser to Firefox.

<p>I feel like I've learned a lot more today than I initially expected to.  After reviewing some interface tutorials, I managed to complete the Rollong a Ball project. located at https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial

Although the product produced was very simple, actually running through the motions of creating a game gave me a much better idea of how many features of the program work, including rigid bodies which allow for physics simulations, materials that allow for coloring or texturing objects, and prefabs, which allow for the generation of identical objects within a game.

I also got my first chance to script in C#, and founnd that my extremely basic knowledge of the syntax was sufficient for following the tutorial.  Additionally, there is an extensive document with all of the unity specific functions, and hitting control + ' allows for research in a way very similar to writing a ? and then hitting tab in SageMath.

After completing the project, I looked into some of the tutorials explaiining the concets of the physics engine, mostly as a review.  There were a few options not covered in the Roll a Ball project though, such as the ability to prevent rotation in certain axes.

Overall, Unity is more physics-based than I anticipated, but there will probably still be a good amount of time spent figuring out the coding.  The project definitely feels much more doable after dippping my feet in and actually creating something with Unity.
